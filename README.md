No shot someone is reading this lol.
This is a thing.
Hopefully it works out.
If it doesn't it's still here,
so who's really keeping score
I'm gonna turn this thing into a different thing now.

The commands to turn this thing on locally so far are npm start for the frontend, venv\Scripts\activate then Python app.py for the backend
